# Initial setup for my MacOS computers

Every once and a while, I format my computers or buy a new one (not so often)


This project will install:

* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com)
* [Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/)
* ... and more
